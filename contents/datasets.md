<h3 style="color:brown;">Synthetic Datasets</h3>
I am working to explore new dimensions in the domain of generative AI, focusing on the creation and curation of datasets for medical imaging, face biometrics, and child data. My goal is to push the boundaries of AI's application in these sensitive and impactful areas, ensuring ethical, accurate, and innovative outcomes. I have created synthetic datasets for various computer vision applications using stable diffsuion and large langauge models (LLM's),  which include dermoscopic skin lesion dataset, Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD), child race data, and child face data. These datasets are designed to advance research and development in critical areas which includes medical imaging, face biometrics and GDPR.

#### DermT2IM Dataset
1. The Dataset6K folder consist of two main classes which includes Benign and Malignant data samples each having 3k data samples.
2. The Smart transformation folder consist of three subfolders which inlcudes tiny benign mole, large malignant moles and multiple moles each having advanced skin lesion augmentation results.

<h3 style="color:brown;">Real World Datasets</h3>

In addition to synthetic datasets I have also acquired and open-sourced real-world thermal imaging out cabin dataset recorded via LWIR 640X480 uncooled thermal imaging camera for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). 

#### C3I Thermal Automative Dataset
The C3I Thermal Automotive Dataset provides > 35,000 distinct frames along with annotated thermal frames for the development of smart thermal perception system/ object detection system that will enable the automotive industry and researchers to develop safer and more efficient ADAS and self-driving car systems. The overall dataset is acquired, processed, and open-sourced in challenging weather and environmental scenarios. The dataset is recorded from a lost-cost yet effective 640x480 uncooled LWIR thermal camera. The dataset is gathered by mounting the camera stand-alone and on an electric vehicle to minimize mechanical vibrations.
