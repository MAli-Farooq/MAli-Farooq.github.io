I have been working as a Research Fellow at the University of Galway and Machine Learning Research Intern at Fotonation. My research focuses on Generative AI, Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, and Edge Computing. I have extensive experience working with various image modalities, including thermal, RGBD, and event-based neuromorphic imaging, integrating them with machine learning algorithms to develop smart imaging pipelines for different computer vision applications. I began my Ph.D. in September 2019 and completed it within three years at the University of Galway. My research was part of the EU-funded 'tHErmaL vIsion AUgmented awarenesS' project, focusing on in-cabin driver monitoring systems (DMS), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and on-chip edge deployment for real-time testing. My contributions included the development and deployment of various in-cabin and out-cabin applications, such as autonomous thermal gender classification, large-scale synthetic thermal data generation, and object detection in the thermal spectrum using state-of-the-art YOLO frameworks. I also optimized neural networks using TensorRT and TensorFlow-Lite and deployed them on edge-GPU devices like Nvidia Jetson Nano and Xavier. Further I am actively collaborating with research engineers and professionals from European and American companies, including Xperi Corporation (U.S.), Lynred (France), Next2U (Italy), Denso (Germany), and Boston Scientific (Ireland). These collaborations led to several joint publications in journals and conference proceedings. Since 2019, I have served as an active reviewer for prestigious engineering journals, including IEEE Access, SPIE Journal of Electronic Imaging, SPIE Journal of Remote Sensing, and Springer Nature Scientific Reports.
