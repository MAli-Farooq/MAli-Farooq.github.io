### 2023
- I delivered a lecture/tutorial on "Domain Adaptation Using GANs and Other State-of-the-Art Generative Neural Technologies to Build Facial Data Samples at Scale" at the Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference 2023 (IMVIP23). This event was held at the University of Galway, where I also served as Program Chair.

- Presented and won first place poster award Paper 'Will your Doorbell Camera still recognize you as you grow old' at NUIG College of Sceince and Engineering (CSE) Research and Innovation Day Program 2023. This work explores the effect of age and aging on the performance of facial authentication methods.

- Presented my work and results for all the work packages (WP-4, WP-7 and WP-8) of Heliaus EU Project in Lindau-Germany to Europen Research Council (ERC) Scientific Council team. The project aims to deliver breakthrough smart thermal perception systems for in-cabin passengers monitoring, as well as for the car surrounding by developing advanced imaging pipelines using SoA Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms that extend the current systems to the LWIR bandwidth.

- Presented my PhD thesis, which explores the use of Longe Wave Thermal Imaging (LWIR) for Driver Monitoring System (DMS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This research delves into the development and integration of thermal imaging technologies to enhance occupant and vehicle safety and performance. By leveraging thermal sensors, the study aims to improve the detection of pedestrians, vehicles, and other obstacles in low-visibility conditions such as nighttime or adverse weather. The core aspects include the design of novel image processing algorithms, the evaluation of sensor fusion techniques, and the assessment of real-world application scenarios by deploying the tuned thermal models on low powered edge devices. Join me on this journey as I share my discoveries, challenges, and the future directions of my work.
